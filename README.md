A block of blue ice is crafted using 81 blocks of regular ice, making it $$81,000 kg$$. Steve's inventory can hold 36 slots. If each of these slots is filled with shulker boxes each carrying 27 slots of full stacks of blue ice, Steve would weigh $$5,038,848,000 kg$$.

Jumping from build height to bedrock of $$384 m$$ assuming Minecraft's gravitation pull of $$31.32 ms^{-2}$$ releases $$13.78$$ terajoules, equivalent to $$8778$$ cubic meters of TNT exploding.
